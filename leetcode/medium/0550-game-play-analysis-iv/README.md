## Problem

Table: `Activity`

```
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.

```

Write a solution to report the  **fraction**  of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in,  **rounded to 2 decimal places**. In other words, you need to determine the number of players who logged in on the day immediately following their initial login, and divide it by the number of total players.

The result format is in the following example.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: 
Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
Output: 
+-----------+
| fraction  |
+-----------+
| 0.33      |
+-----------+
Explanation: 
Only the player with id 1 logged back in after the first day he had logged in so the answer is 1/3 = 0.33

```

    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY player_id
)

SELECT ROUND(COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity), 2) AS fraction
FROM Activity
JOIN first_login
ON Activity.player_id = first_login.player_id AND Activity.event_date = DATE_ADD(first_login.first_login_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
```
